# Machine Learning study notes
This repository is a collection of my Machine Learning study notes. The notes
are written in the form of Jupyter notebooks. For reasons I don't know, GitHub 
somehow messes up most of the formattings of the notebooks (internal hyperlink,
LaTeX, animated GIF, ...etc.) Therefore I would recommend Jupyter's 
[nbview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to render the notebooks. Links are
provided in the following.

For those who come from operational research fields (such as Physics, Chemistry, 
Biology, Statistics, ..etc), I would strongly recommend the two excellent books below 
if you somehow decided to explore the field of Data Science and Machine Learning:

- Aurélien Géron: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
- Francois Chollet: Deep Learning with Python

Using production-ready Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, Aurélien's book first covers 
traditional learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, 
Decision Tree, Ensemble Learning, and Dimensionality Reduction. The second part of 
Aurélien's book focuses on deep learning. Here he first explores neural network basics, 
then dive into convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and deep 
reinforcement learning. ``Hands-on'' gives pretty good code examples and _just enough_
theoretical backgrounds for those who are interested in what's happening in the
algorithms under the hood. 

Francois is the author of Keras, a high-level, super flexible, and super user-friendly 
TensorFlow API. The beauty of Keras is that it not only allows you to painlessly build 
complex networks in a snap, but also has the capability to link up TensorFlow's lower
level functionality. These two features make Keras one of the most powerful deep learning
framework. As such, Francois' book only focuses on deep learning and Keras. The book
covers deep learning fundamentals, Keras usage, and best practices in deep learning.
Francois also sprinkles his personal takes on the trend of Artificial Intelligence/Deep 
Learning over the entire book. I find his thoughts extremely valuable. If you'd like
to know what I mean, head to the last chapter of the book. I would say this is my
most favorite deep learning reference.

I make these notes to prepare myself for a career transition. I also hope the notes
are useful in your journey to Machine Learning. 

Feedbacks are welcome.

Thanks, and Happy Learning!
