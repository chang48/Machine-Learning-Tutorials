# Machine Learning study notes
This repository is a collection of my Machine Learning study notes. They are
written in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Since GitHub is having some issues 
with some of the notebook files, it is recommended to use Jupyter's 
[nbview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to render the notes. Links are
provided in the following.

I use the following books as my primary study materials

- Aurélien Géron: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
- Francois Chollet: Deep Learning with Python

The first part of Aurélien's book covers traditional machine learning techniques 
such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Ensemble Learning,
and Dimensionality Reduction. Deep learning algorithms (CNN, RNN, Reinforcement 
Learning) are discussed in the the second half of the book. ``Hands-on'' has good 
code examples and _just enough_ theoretical backgrounds for those who are interested 
in what's happening under the hood in machine learning algorithms.

Francois is the author of Keras, a flexible and user-friendly TensorFlow API. 
So ``Deep Learning with Python'' focuses solely on deep learning and Keras. The book
covers deep learning fundamentals, Keras usage, and best practices in deep learning.
The book also has excellent code examples, many of them have comments that make the
codes easier to understand. Francois also sprinkles his personal takes on the trend 
of Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning over the entire book. I find his thoughts 
quite insightful.

I write these notes in order to prepare myself for a career transition. They are
definitely not to be used to replace the books and lectures. But if you find these
notes helpful in your journey to machine learning, feel free to use them.

Thanks, and happy learning!

PS: Some figures included in the notes are collected from the books and online
resources. I claim no copyrights of these figures.
