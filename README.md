# Machine Learning study notes
This is a collection of my study notes of machine learning algorithms. The notes
are written in the form of Jupyter notebooks. For reasons I don't know, GitHub 
somehow messes up the internal hyperlink function and does not work well with
some LaTeX syntaxes. For these reasons, I would recommend using Jupyter's 
[nbview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to render the notebooks. Links are
provided in the following.

1. [Ensemble Learning](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chang48/Machine-Learning-notes/blob/master/Ensemble-Learning.ipynb)
2. [Deep Learning 01: Neural Networks - Basics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chang48/Machine-Learning-study-notes/blob/master/DeepLearning-01-Neural-Networks-Basics.ipynb)
3. [Deep Learning 02: Neural Networks - Backpropagation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chang48/Machine-Learning-study-notes/blob/master/DeepLearning-02-Neural-Networks-Backpropagation.ipynb)
4. [Deep Learning 03: Neural Networks - Practical Advices](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chang48/Machine-Learning-study-notes/blob/master/DeepLearning-03-Neural-Networks-Practical-Advices.ipynb)
5. [Deep Learning 04: Convolutional Neural Network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chang48/Machine-Learning-study-notes/blob/master/DeepLearning-04-Convolutional-Neural-Networks.ipynb) - Github completely messes up the animated GIF in the notebook. Use this nbview version.
6. [Deep Learning 05: CNN in action: the MNIST challenge](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chang48/Machine-Learning-study-notes/blob/master/DeepLearning-05-CNN-MNIST.ipynb)
